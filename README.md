# Boost Your React Apps with Apollo (Thinkster.io)
Hi! [Sam Julien](http://www.samjulien.com/) here. You've reached the repsitory for sample code and exercises for my series on Apollo Client for [Thinkster](http://thinkster.io). 

This repository contains a GraphQL server (in `/server`) used throughout the series, as well as folders for each tutorial. Each tutorial folder contains starting points (where applicable) and finished code, as well as any exercises included.

To get started with the server:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

## Table of Contents
- [01: First Steps with Apollo & React](./01-first-steps/)
- [02: Fetching and Updating Data](./02-fetching-and-updating/)
- [03: Beyond the Basics](./03-beyond-the-basics)

## A Note on the Beta
In this series, we're using Apollo Client 3. At time I'm recording this, v3 is still in beta. I have it on good authority that the material I'm covering won't change after the release, but rest assured that I'll be updating anything that changes. In any case, you may see the beta version pop up in some of the videos or the sample code. Don't worry about it unless something is broken (in which case let me know)! 

## Why a habit tracker?
The sample project in this course is inspired by the work of people like [Amy Hoy & Alex Hillman](https://stackingthebricks.com/), [James Clear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear)'s [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), and [BJ Fogg](https://twitter.com/bjfogg)'s [Tiny Habits](https://www.tinyhabits.com/book). Because of these people, I've learned that big life changes usually happen in tiny steps made consistently!
