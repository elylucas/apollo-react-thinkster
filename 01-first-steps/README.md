# First Steps with Apollo & React
Welcome to the first tutorial on using Apollo Client with React! In this section, we'll get you started with the basics. You'll first learn about what GraphQL and Apollo are and why you might use them. Then, you'll set up Apollo with React and write your very first query. My goal for you by the end of this section is that you'll get a good feel for why Apollo is so massively popular with React!

## Exercises
As you'll be following along to build the client in this tutorial, it only has one true exercise/assignment at the end:

- Modify the first query we wrote to include more data from the server and update the UI accordingly.

The [finished code](./finished-code/) for this tutorial also serves as the solution to this exercise.
